## Branch Naming Guidelines

1. Try to use **short**, **less verbose** branch names
2. They should use one of the following start descriptors:

   | Descriptor | When it should be used       |
   | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
   | `impl`     | An addition (implementation) |
   | `del`      | A deletion                   |

3. Then, add a very short **dash-separated** name related to the branch, for example `function-call` or `type-inference`

Some examples of what a branch could look like:

- `impl/variable-assign`
- `del/verbose-error`
- `impl/function-definition`

## How Can I Help?!?!

### Writing Code

See the [trello](https://trello.com/b/5gxtFXun/fluo) for a list of things that need to be done. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/MonliH/fluo/pulls) and explain your changes. For large changes, it is recommened to create an issue first. This way, you can feedback from others.

### Bug reports and suggestions

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/MonliH/fluo/issues)

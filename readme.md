[Original `master branch`](https://github.com/fluo-lang/fluoc/tree/master), rewritten. Currently a WIP with a mix of syntax and semantics from Haskell, Rust, and Go:

## Design

- Simple
- Refinement Types
- No garbage collector, but it feels like there is one (based off work from [Proust (ASAP)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-908.pdf) and [Corbyn (Practical Static Memory Management)](http://nathancorbyn.com/nc513.pdf))
